# Retail Data Analysis & Budgeting System

The Online Retail Data Analysis project aims to extract actionable business insights from a large e-commerce transactional dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). The dataset contains approximately 500,000 online retail transactions made between 2010 and 2011 by customers across various countries.

* Data Aggregation and Metric Calculation
* Data Visualization with Tableau
* Revenue Forecasting and Budget Tracking

### Tools & Technology

### Business Questions Explored

* What are the top-selling products and peak sales periods?
* Which countries generate the most revenue?
* How do customer purchasing behaviors vary across regions?
* Who are the most valuable customers, and how can we segment them?
